**What is PySpace**

Pyspace is my Python project, which is software for performing computations related to astronomy and orbital mechanics. It is based on the 'SPICE' toolkit developed by NASA.

**Installing the required modules**
```
spiceypy
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
```

***Main Features***
+ Earth.py --- Calculates the Earth velocity and its distance from the Sun
+ First_kepler.py --- Calculates and plots the trajectory of the Solar System Barycentre in relation to the Sun and its distance from the Sun
+ Venus.py --- Calculates and plots the phase angels between the different planets, sun and the moon and detect when the system is photographable.


***TODO***
+ At the moment, every task performed by the software requires execution through a separate .py file. 
I want to standardize the program and add a GUI menu using Tkinter or PyQt5.
+ I want to add more functionality to the program.
